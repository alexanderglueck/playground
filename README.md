# Playground

A playground where I play with different packages and Docker setups. 

## Ideas

- [ ] Look into [archtechx/tenancy](https://github.com/archtechx/tenancy) 
  - Experiment with the subdomain approach (see Slack)
- [ ] Check out [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) 
- [ ] Optimize Dockerfile
  - Investigate opcache
  - Improve readability and image size
- [ ] Research "correct" timezone handling
  - Store everything in UTC
  - Display in local timezone
  - Deal with local timezones (Send less important notifications only during 06:00 and 18:00 (local timezone))
- [ ] L10n and i18n
